#Solr Test document generator

This PHP script helps to generate an arbitrary random text documents which can be used to test a Solr instance.

I created it for my own purposes. Changes will most likely be necessary.

##Ho it works

Pretty simplistic. Sentences are generated by randomly picking words from a dictionary (which is not included.) Every now and then, a short word like "as", "for", "in" etc. is inserted to make it look more natural.

##Output

One XML file per document, which can be submitted to a Solr update request handler.

##Requirements

Needs PHP. Best is to run the scipt on the command line.

##Where to get a Dictionary

Here, for example:

##Performance

Generation of documents is pretty slow. On my machine, creating 100 documents takes 4 minutes to create.
